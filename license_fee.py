    Works out the cost required to buy a specific ad slot.  This is based on the time
    of day, and the budget/earnings of the movie being shown before the
    chosen ad slot.

    This function is applied to a schedule dataframe to create a new column
    containing the ad slot prices, returns NaN if the slot is not an ad slot.

    This is also multiplied by the prime time factor, desired profit margin does
    not take into account the effects of prime time factor currently, i.e.
    there'll be a larger profit margin obtained than the one specified for spots
    in prime time.
